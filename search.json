    "text": "It can be hard to communicate the benefit of open-source collaboration, the effort that goes into it, and its enormous impact on data science, to a non-technical audience. Visualizations can be very helpful here and we created a video showing the first six months of development of the mmrm R package. The video is based on the cumulative commit history of the git repository where the package development happens. It shows contributions to the “main” branch of the repository and how contributors add or edit files. Files are visualized by dots and arranged in a tree structure defined by the folders in the repository. The video is optimized for full HD quality.\n\n\nOnly direct code contributions are shown. This does not include, ideation, community organization, code reviews, bug reporting, or answering questions, and promoting the package - all of which are important to make such a project a long-term success.\nIf you want to co-star in the next iteration of the video, check out the mmrm git repository, get in touch and contribute! Our contribution guidelines can be found here.\nWe used gource to create the video following an example and guide by Nan Xiao."

    "text": "On Friday February 10, Daniel, Friedrich, and Kevin held a one-day workshop on good software engineering practice for R (GSWEP4R) in Basel. In order to achieve the best learning experience for participants, we only offered this course face to face without dialing in option - and the 50 seats had been booked out quickly within days after the course had been announced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe covered topics from R package basics over development workflows, quality, and modern collaboration tools to publishing. We consider democratizing these skills crucial to foster a vibrant R package ecosystem in biostatics. Even if you do not intend to write your own package, a solid understanding of how all of this fits together enables you to participate in the community and positively influence future development by reporting bugs, giving feedback, or bringing your methodological expertise to the table of open-source development.\nWe thank the BBS for supporting the workshop, Roche for hosting the event, and the participants for a lively and inspiring atmosphere.\nThe course materials are online under CC-BY license here and the source code for all materials is available here.\nWe also plan to repeat the course in other locations in the future - please reach out if you are interested to work with the SWE WG to host a course!"

    "section": "FDA presentation",
    "text": "FDA presentation\nPaul Schuette gave the second presentation on “Open-source software for regulatory submissions and regulatory environments”, which is available on the R Submissions WG website here. Paul started by reminding us of FDA’s clarifying statement on software, which was already published in May 2015. After noting that he could only comment on the CDER side of FDA for submissions, he commented on the Study Data Technical Conformance Guide (SDTCG). The SDTCG in particular mandates that all source code for ADaM data sets, as well as TLGs for primary and secondary efficacy analyses need to be submitted. Paul noted that while ASCII files are required and non-ASCII characters are to be avoided, the files could still be with .r extension - not only .txt files are allowed. Interestingly even .jl i.e. Julia files are allowed for module 5 content (although they have not received any Julia submission), while .sas and .r are allowed for modules 3 to 5. In the future they would like to be able to support more formats.\n\nHistory of R\nLooking at the history of R, he noted that it followed S which was developed in the same building from Bell Labs as C and Unix, by John Chambers et al. R’s major innovation in the 1990s was the CRAN repository. RStudio as a popular IDE is available since 2011. With R Core and the R Foundation, a governance structure is in place. Discussing the various R community based WGs, Paul highlighted the R Submissions WG that already has completed 3 pilot submissions. Currently, pilot 4 with a container or web assembly based submission is under development. Paul also mentioned Python, which is used in a complementary set of applications such as natural language processing and machine learning, and less in statistics and visualization. He noted that also some commercial software is written in Python. Julia seems to be not (yet?) of great importance in the statistics community.\n\n\nR for submissions\nOpen source software comes with benefits but also challenges. Paul noted the higher pace of changes in the software, and the missing support process when something goes wrong. The need for IT departments supporting the software installations can be another challenge. With almost 20,000 contributed R packages on CRAN, it is not trivial to decide which R packages to trust.\nZooming in on the use of R for submissions, Paul noted that CDER has not received yet a purely R based submission. So far, hybrid submissions combining R and proprietary software have been successfully received. Statistical reviewers also have been using R, in particular for plots that have in some instances already made it into labels. New graduates often come with R knowledge, however best practices are not taught in graduate schools. Paul recommended to reach out to the review divisions early before submissions, and to keep in mind the perspective of the statistical reviewers, who are using laptops for their review work.\nPaul finished with the Stan Lee quote “With great power comes great responsibility”, reminding us that we need to use the power of open source software responsibly."

    "href": "blog/risw2023_session/index.html#panel-discussion",
    "title": "Considerations in developing and using open-source statistical software in Pharma",
    "section": "Panel discussion",
    "text": "Panel discussion\n\n\n\nPanel discussion\n\n\n\nPopularity of R\nNing started the panel discussion with asking how popular R is in the companies and FDA. Paul mentioned that they have been seeing an uptick in the recent graduates with R and Python background during the last 5 years. They also encourage staff to be bilingual in the programming languages to increase flexibility. Ryan added that he personally uses R a lot, e.g. to replicate sponsor analyses, and conduct FDA in-house analyses/visualization. Some reviewers use Python but it is only for research purposes not for regulatory purposes. The FDA’s Division of Analytics and Informatics (DAI) also has lots of talented R programmers. Eric added that in Eli Lilly they use R more and more, and Daniel added that in Roche Pharma new molecules from this year onwards start their study data analyses in R.\n\n\nQuality Assessment\nThe next question was how the panel members assessed the quality of the packages. Daniel looks always at the source code of the package, which is nowadays typically available on GitHub - are tests included? If there are tests, are they meaningful and sufficiently granular? If yes, are functions documented? Are vignettes available? Eric added that documentation is very important for him to get started with a package, so is a key criterion. A great example here is the targets package from Will Landau. Paul mentioned that often he does not have a lot of time for the assessment, and provenance is an important factor: do you know where the package came from? Ryan added that not all packages meet the requirements of the reviewers, the issue already arose in one case where a package affiliated with LaTeX was utilized to provide improved fonts in R markdown. The package was rejected in the end because it could not be resolved. He added that well known packages are easier to accept, while not open sourced, proprietary packages would take a lot of time to review and test.\n\n\nPackage Dependencies\nIt was great to have a lot of the questions subsequently from the audience. The first was around package dependencies and how to deal with them. Eric mentioned that this was a key issue for the R Submission WG and its pilot submissions to the FDA, where renv has been used successfully. A key factor here was to be very verbose in the reviewers guide - you cannot be detailed enough because you want to make sure it can be reproduced on any machine. Also doing the work openly on GitHub helps to be transparent to the reviewers.\n\n\nCommercial Models\nAnother question was whether commercial maintenance of open source packages could be an option, similar as RedHat for Linux. Paul commented that there were different models for monetizing open source software, he is aware of at least three different ones which come with their challenges. Generally, he encourages open source publication of packages and also harmonized cross-company efforts, to avoid surprises in submissions. The open source nature is an opportunity to avoid repeating the company specific macros submissions from sponsors for proprietary software seen in the past.\n\n\nContainerization\nOne question was whether the use of containers could help solve the reproducibility challenge posed from different R and packages installations, and whether this could be integrated into the workflow of statistical reviewers at FDA potentially. Paul commented that there are several pain points. One was e.g. that containers work best with Linux operating systems, while reviewers work on Windows systems. Therefore, IT support was required which adds a level of complexity for the setup. Currently, other solutions are being discussed as part of Pilot 4 of the R Submissions WG. One of them is webR, where it was important that the security requirements are fulfilled because sessions would be sandboxed in the reviewer’s browser session, as Eric added.\n\n\nNewcomers\nA follow on question to the quality assessment discussion was how newcomers to the biostatistics community could make sure that their packages can be accepted, although they might be unknown in the first place to the community. Daniel started by emphasizing that for him assessing the quality of the packages is not primarily driven by the authors - newcomers could do a great job with using best practices (including methods description in vignettes, tests, documentation, user vignettes, GitHub issues tracking, CRAN publication etc). Paul added that dissemination is important, e.g. Journal of Statistical Software and others are important outlets. Eric added that the R Weekly site and R Weekly Highlights podcast, which regularly feature new and updated packages released in the R community, is another great way to publicize a new package and increase adoption.\n\n\nHPC\nThe last question was whether extensive computing (e.g. cloud based sponsor submissions) could be handled during an FDA statistical review. Paul mentioned that unfortunately cloud based solutions are not currently compatible with security and other regulatory requirements. However, statistical reviewers have access to an FDA HPC environment, but the access process is not trivial, and can be time intensive.\n\n\n\nPanel discussion"

    "section": "",
    "text": "With the shift of biostatistics work from proprietary software (e.g. SAS) to R, it is now even more important to write reliable and reproducible code, and to be selective with the R packages we use. This topic is equally relevant for biostatistics work as it is for programming and other roles. A recent panel discussion on this topic highlighted this evolving need across companies and academia.\nTo foster collaboration within biostatistics across organizational silos we proposed a new scientific working group under the umbrella of the American Statistical Association (ASA) Biopharmaceutical section (BIOP) which was quickly approved in August this year: The Software Engineering working group (SWE WG). Now we have launched our landing page and website (hosted by the R Consortium GitHub organization) and want to share this news broadly to raise awareness and attract contributors. We have more than 10 companies and institutions involved in the SWE WG and welcome new members.\nThe primary objective of the SWE WG is to engineer R packages that implement important methods that are often utilized in biostatistics but still missing from our R toolbox. The first product is the recently-published R package implementing mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM): mmrm. In particular, a critical advantage of this package over existing implementations is that it is faster and converges more reliably. It also provides a comprehensive set of features: users can specify a variety of covariance matrices, weight observations, fit models with restricted or standard maximum likelihood inference, perform hypothesis testing with Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom, and extract the least square means estimates by using the emmeans package. We aim to establish the R package mmrm as a new standard for fitting MMRM and will communicate it broadly. We welcome any community contributions to the R package, including feedback, questions and feature requests.\nThe secondary objective is to develop best practices for engineering high-quality open-source statistical software, and to promote the use of these best practices in the broader biostatistics community via public training materials.\n➞ Would you like to try out the new package mmrm? Install it from CRAN and read the documentation (hosted by the openpharma GitHub organization).\n➞ What do you think is missing in the statisticians’ R toolbox?
