As part of our goal to engineer R packages to fill in gaps in the open-source statistical software landscape, we collect ideas and project proposals for public discussion.

The aim is to refine the idea into a concrete project, agree on requirements, and identify interested developers.

To add a start a new idea discussion, please contact us via [contact form](contact_us.qmd), send a PR on [github](https://www.github.com/openstatsware/website), or start a discussion in our [github discussion board](https://github.com/openstatsware/website/discussions).
