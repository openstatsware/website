# Introducing openstatsware

## Background

```{r calc-stats}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
members <- read_csv("../data/members.csv") |> filter(SWE_WG_Member == 1)
n_members <- nrow(members)
unique_orgs <- members |> pull("Affiliation") |> unique() |> sort()
```


-   Formed on 19 August 2022
-   Official working group of the [American Statistical Association (ASA) Biopharmaceutical section (BIOP)](https://community.amstat.org/biop/home)
-   Special Interest Group (SIG) of the [European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry (EFSPI)](https://www.efspi.org/).
-   Cross-industry collaboration (`r n_members` members from `r length(unique_orgs)` organizations)
-   Homepage: [openstatsware.org](https://www.openstatsware.org/)
-   We welcome new members to join!


## Motivation

-   Open-source software increasingly popular in Biostatistics
    -   Rapid uptake of novel statistical methods
    -   Unprecedented opportunities for collaboration
    -   Transparency of methods and implementation
-   Variability in software quality
    -   No statistical quality assurance on open-source extension package repositories, e.g. CRAN
    -   No industry standard for assessing quality of R packages
-   **Reliable software for core statistical analyses is paramount**


# Our work

## Objectives

-   **Engineer selected packages** to fill in gaps in the open-source statistical software landscape, and to promote software tools designed by the working group through publications, conference presentations, workshops, and training courses.

-   **Develop good SWE practices** for engineering high-quality statistical software and promote their use in the broader Biostatistics community via public training materials.

-   **Communicate and collaborate** with other R software initiatives including via the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/).

We complement the various other R and open source initiatives and statistics SIGs as a bridge between statistical methodology and software.
Other groups that we have connections to are Pharmaverse, R Submission Working Group, R Repository Working Group, PSI AIMS, CAMIS, and R Validation Hub.

## Workstreams in Package Development

Members from different companies have collaborated on a number of statistical software projects:

-   Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (MMRM)
    -   Developed the [`mmrm`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mmrm) R package for frequentist inference in MMRM
-   Bayesian MMRM
    -   Developed the [`brms.mmrm`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=brms.mmrm) R package for Bayesian inference in MMRM
-   Health Technology Assessment (HTA)
    -   Developed the [`maicplus`](https://hta-pharma.github.io/maicplus/) R package for matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC)
-   Bayesian Safety Signal Detection
    -   Developed the [`SafetySignalDetection.jl`](https://openpharma.github.io/SafetySignalDetection.jl/) Julia package

## Best Practices Dissemination

Our members are widely engaged with teaching and outreach to encourage best practice in statistical software development.

### Workshops

-   Workshop "Good Software Engineering Practice for R Packages" on world tour
-   To teach hands-on skills and tools to engineer reliable R packages
    -   Topics: R package structure, engineering workflow, ensuring quality, version control, collaboration and publication, and shiny development
-   5 events in 2023 in Basel, Shanghai, San Jos√©, Rockville, and Montreal
-   4 events in 2024 in Zurich, Salzburg, Beijing, and [online at R/Pharma APAC](https://openpharma.github.io/workshop-r-swe-rinpharma-2024/)

### openstatsguide

-   [Found online here](https://openstatsware.org/guide.html)
-   Small and concise set of recommendations for package developers
-   Opinionated, but aims to be based on experienced majority opinions
-   Focus are developers, while users might find complementary "validation" frameworks valuable
-   Primarily for statistical packages (not plotting, data wrangling, etc.)
-   Generic principles which can be used across functional data science languages R, Python, and Julia
-   Concrete tools are mentioned as examples
